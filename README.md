# Wave_Dark_Matter - Folders and What They Contain
1. PDE_Numerical_Solutions contains following methods: 
  - a. Explicit Method to solve heat equation and Schrodinger's equation.
  - b. Cranck Nicolson Method to solve heat equation and Schrodinger's equation.
2. Obtaining_Power_Spectrum
  - a. FDM_NoSelfInteractions.ipynb solves the growth equation for structure formation for a single value of k and for a range of k values in matter- dominant era for CDM and FDM.
  - b. FDM_WithSelfInteractions.ipynb includes the self-interaction term and then models density perturbation evolution for single value of k in matter-dominant era. 
  - c. For b., solve the equation for a range of k values and obtain the power spectra.
